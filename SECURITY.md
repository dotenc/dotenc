## Threat Model

dotenc is designed to protect secrets at rest in a Git repository. Its security model assumes:

**Protected against:**
- An attacker who can read the repository (including all `.enc` files and public keys in `.dotenc/`) but does not have access to any authorized SSH private key
- Accidental secret exposure through environment variable leakage to child processes
- Tampering with encrypted files (authenticated encryption detects modification)
- Path traversal or command injection via user-supplied names and editor configuration

**Not protected against:**
- An attacker who has already obtained an authorized SSH private key
- Secrets that were previously exposed before being stored in dotenc
- Secrets known to a user before their access was revoked (see [Access Control Model](#access-control-model))
- A compromised machine where decryption takes place (memory forensics, malicious processes)
- Passphrase-protected keys when no passphrase source is provided — dotenc does not prompt interactively for passphrases; see [Known Limitations](#known-limitations)

---

## Cryptographic Design

### Envelope Encryption

dotenc uses envelope encryption: each environment has a single randomly generated **data key**, and that data key is individually encrypted for each authorized user using their SSH public key.

```
Environment secrets
        │
        ▼ AES-256-GCM (data key + env name as AAD)
        │
Encrypted ciphertext (.env.*.enc)

Data key
        │
        ├─▶ ECIES encrypt (Ed25519 public key) → stored in .env.*.enc
        └─▶ RSA-OAEP encrypt (RSA public key)  → stored in .env.*.enc
```

This means:
- Only authorized users can decrypt the data key, and therefore the environment
- Re-keying an environment (adding or revoking access) only re-encrypts the data key, not the environment contents
- Rotating the data key generates a new random key and re-encrypts all environment contents

### Algorithms

| Operation | Algorithm | Parameters |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Environment encryption | AES-256-GCM | 96-bit random IV, 128-bit auth tag |
| Additional Authenticated Data | Environment name bound to ciphertext | Prevents ciphertext swap across environments |
| Data key encryption (Ed25519 keys) | ECIES (`eciesjs` v0.4+) | X25519 ECDH + AES-GCM |
| Data key encryption (RSA keys) | RSA-OAEP | SHA-256 |
| Supported public key types | Ed25519, RSA ≥ 2048-bit | ECDSA and DSA are rejected |

**IV generation:** A fresh 12-byte random IV is generated for every encryption operation using Node.js `crypto.randomBytes()`. IVs are never reused.

**Authentication:** AES-256-GCM provides authenticated encryption. Any modification to the ciphertext, auth tag, or IV is detected during decryption and results in an error. The environment name is included as Additional Authenticated Data (AAD), preventing a ciphertext from one environment from being replayed against another.

### Data Key Lifecycle

1. On `dotenc env create` or `dotenc env edit`, a new 32-byte random data key is generated
2. The data key is encrypted for each authorized public key and stored in the `.enc` file header
3. The data key is never written to disk in plaintext
4. On decryption, the data key is held in memory only for the duration of the operation, then explicitly zeroed

---

## Key Material Handling

### Private Key Isolation

**SSH private keys stay in `~/.ssh/`** — dotenc reads them in place and never copies, moves, or stores them elsewhere. When `dotenc key add --from-private-key <name>` or an interactive key-selection flow is used, dotenc loads the selected private key only long enough to derive and store its public key in `.dotenc/<name>.pub`; the private key itself is not written to the repository.

**In-memory zeroing:** After the private key is used to decrypt the data key, the raw key bytes are explicitly overwritten with zeros before being released:

```typescript
// cli/src/helpers/decryptDataKey.ts
try {
    return eciesDecrypt(rawSeed, encryptedDataKey)
} finally {
    rawSeed.fill(0)   // zero Ed25519 seed bytes
    privDer.fill(0)   // zero DER-encoded private key buffer
}
```

**Provider bootstrap keys:** CI and provider runners should store bootstrap
private keys as `DOTENC_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64`, a base64-encoded private key file.
`DOTENC_PRIVATE_KEY` with raw private key text remains supported for backwards
compatibility. Passphrase-protected bootstrap keys use
`DOTENC_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE` with either format.

**Child process isolation:** When running commands with `dotenc run` or
`dotenc dev`, the `DOTENC_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64` and `DOTENC_PRIVATE_KEY`
environment variables are explicitly stripped from the child process
environment before launch. Injected secrets are limited to the decrypted
variables only:

```typescript
// cli/src/commands/run.ts
const {
    DOTENC_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64: _privateKeyBase64,
    DOTENC_PRIVATE_KEY: _privateKey,
    ...baseEnv
} = process.env
const mergedEnv = { ...baseEnv, ...decryptedEnv }
spawn(command, args, { env: mergedEnv })
```

### Temporary File Security

`dotenc env edit` decrypts the environment into a temporary file for editing. This file is handled securely:

- Created in a temporary directory with mode `0o600` (readable only by the current user)
- **Overwritten with zeros** before deletion, preventing recovery from the filesystem:

```typescript
// cli/src/commands/env/edit.ts
const stat = await fs.stat(tempFilePath)
await fs.writeFile(tempFilePath, Buffer.alloc(stat.size, 0))
```

- Signal handlers for `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` ensure secure erasure even if the process is interrupted mid-edit

### File Permissions

| Resource | Mode | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| SSH key directory (`~/.ssh/`) | `0o700` | Created if absent |
| Temporary plaintext files | `0o600` | Zeroed before deletion |
| `.env.*.enc` files | Default umask | Encrypted; safe to be world-readable |
| `.dotenc/*.pub` files | Default umask | Public keys; intentionally public |

## Input Validation and Injection Prevention

**Environment and key names** are validated with a strict whitelist — only alphanumeric characters, dots, hyphens, and underscores are accepted. The values `.` and `..` and Windows reserved names (`CON`, `NUL`, `COM1`, etc.) are explicitly rejected.

**Public keys** are validated before use:
- RSA keys shorter than 2048 bits are rejected
- ECDSA and DSA keys are rejected (unsupported)
- Ed25519 keys are accepted as preferred

**Editor commands** (from `$EDITOR`, `$VISUAL`, or `dotenc config editor`) are checked against a shell metacharacter denylist (`$`, `` ` ``, `(`, `)`, `;`, `|`, `<`, `>`, `&`, `!`, newlines) before use. The editor is then executed via `spawnSync` with arguments as an array — not through a shell — so no shell interpolation occurs.

**Child command execution** (`dotenc run`, `dotenc dev`) uses `spawn()` with the command and arguments as separate values, never concatenated into a shell string.

**Decrypted environment content** is parsed with Node's built-in `node:util.parseEnv` parser before variables are passed to child processes.

---

## Access Control Model

Access in dotenc is enforced cryptographically, not by policy:

- A user who is not in the authorized list for an environment cannot decrypt that environment's data key, and therefore cannot read the secrets
- Granting access re-encrypts the data key for the new user's public key; no re-encryption of the environment contents is required
- Revoking access removes the user's encrypted data key copy and re-encrypts the data key for all remaining users (requires the revoking user to have decrypt access)

**Important limitation:** Revoking access prevents future decryption but does not invalidate knowledge of secrets already seen by the revoked user. For full offboarding, rotate the affected external secrets (API keys, database passwords, etc.) and optionally run `dotenc env rotate <environment>` to generate a new data key.

All grant and revoke operations are reflected in Git-tracked files, providing a full audit trail in repository history.

---

## Operational Flow

### Project Root Resolution

When any dotenc command runs, it resolves the **project root** by walking ancestor directories from the current working directory, looking for a `.dotenc/` folder. Key material (public keys) is always read from and written to this resolved root, regardless of where the command was invoked. If no `.dotenc/` folder is found at any ancestor level, the command falls back to the current directory (which applies during `dotenc init` flows).

### Initialization and Clone-Local Git Integration

On first initialization, dotenc registers the selected public key and creates the encrypted development and personal environments. If a plaintext `.env` is migrated, it is removed only after the encrypted development environment has been created successfully. New environment files use exclusive, no-clobber writes, so a file that appears concurrently cannot be overwritten.

When `dotenc init` detects an existing project, it performs Git setup only: it configures `diff.dotenc.textconv` in that clone's local Git configuration and ensures the repository's `*.enc` diff attribute. It does not prompt for or modify identities, keys, encrypted environments, access rules, or a local plaintext `.env`. The Git subprocess result is checked before `.gitattributes` is changed, so a configuration failure aborts without reporting success or leaving a tracked attribute change.

### Hierarchical Environment Loading

`dotenc run` and `dotenc dev` support a hierarchical merge model for monorepo projects:

1. The ancestor chain from the project root to the invocation directory is computed.
2. For each requested environment name, dotenc scans every directory in the chain (root → local) for a `.env.${name}.enc` file.
3. Variables from deeper (more local) files override variables from shallower (root) files for the same name.
4. Missing files at any level are silently skipped — only existing files that fail to decrypt cause an error.

The `--local-only` flag narrows decryption scope to the current directory only, bypassing ancestor scanning entirely.

### Recursive Environment Discovery

Batch operations (`env rotate --all`, `auth purge`) recursively walk the project tree to find all `.env.*.enc` files. The following directories are explicitly excluded from this walk to avoid processing build artifacts or dependency caches: `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `build`, `.next`, `coverage`, `vendor`.

### AAD and Multi-Level Environments

The **Additional Authenticated Data (AAD)** used during AES-256-GCM encryption is the environment name only — not the file path. This means same-named environments at different directory levels (e.g., a `staging` environment at the project root and one in `packages/web`) use the same AAD value. They are treated as independent encrypted files that happen to share a logical name, consistent with the hierarchical merge semantics described above.

---

## Installation Script Trust Model

The VS Code extension offers an installation helper that downloads and runs the dotenc install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://dotenc.org/install.sh | sh
```

This is a standard pattern used by many developer tools (Homebrew, Rust, Node.js version managers, etc.). Security properties:

- **HTTPS only** — the connection is encrypted and the server's identity is verified by TLS certificate
- **User-initiated** — the script runs only when you explicitly trigger the install action; nothing runs automatically
- **Domain controlled by the project** — `dotenc.org` is under project ownership

If you prefer to audit the script before running it, download it first:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://dotenc.org/install.sh -o install.sh
# review install.sh
sh install.sh
```

Alternatively, install via Homebrew, Scoop, npm, the
`ghcr.io/dotenc/cli` OCI image, or a standalone binary from the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dotenc/dotenc/releases) page. None of
these methods use the install script.

---

## Linux Package Repository Trust Model

Official signed APT, RPM, and APK repositories are being prepared at
`packages.dotenc.org`, but they are **not a supported installation method yet**.
The delivery infrastructure exists; launch remains gated on production signing
key custody and a verified first publication. Until that gate passes, use one
of the installation methods listed above.

The planned trust model separates authenticity from delivery:

- APT and RPM use independent OpenPGP v4 RSA trust roots. Each primary key
  remains offline; CI receives only that ecosystem's RSA-4096 signing subkey.
- APT signs `InRelease`, which authenticates repository indexes and the hashes
  of `.deb` files. The `.deb` files do not carry separate dotenc repository
  signatures.
- RPM signs both package files and `repomd.xml`. A separate RSA-4096 Alpine key
  signs APK packages and `APKINDEX.tar.gz` with RSA/SHA-256.
- Arch users receive a `dotenc-bin` AUR recipe that pins the SHA-256 of each
  tagged GitHub release archive. AUR stores build metadata rather than a dotenc
  binary repository, so this path uses none of the APT, RPM, or APK signing
  keys. Its separately gated publisher uses a dedicated AUR-only Ed25519 SSH
  identity and may update only the `dotenc-bin` AUR Git repository. CI accepts
  that identity only as an unencrypted base64-encoded environment secret,
  verifies the server's Ed25519 key against the fingerprint published by AUR,
  and uses strict host-key checking. The key is exposed only after an
  unprivileged, digest-pinned Arch build/install validation succeeds. Manual
  validation authenticates with AUR's read-only `help` command, then exits
  without cloning when publication is disabled. Pushes are non-forced and fail
  closed on downgrades or unexpected repository state.
- Package managers verify those signatures against explicitly installed dotenc
  public keys. HTTPS alone is not the package authenticity boundary.
- A first package publication accepts Linux binaries only from the immutable
  Actions artifact created earlier in the same release run; manual and
  scheduled invocations are refresh-only. Later refreshes authenticate the
  canonical six-package bundle through its APT-subkey-signed digest manifest,
  not through the adjacent mutable checksum alone.
- Versioned packages and content-addressed metadata are immutable. Signed
  mutable repository roots are published last so they never intentionally
  reference objects that have not finished uploading.
- Private signing keys must never be published to the package host, included in
  packages, stored in repository history, or exposed through workflow logs,
  artifacts, or caches.
- APT and RPM signing run in separate ephemeral GPG homes. Alpine signing runs
  in a network-disabled container whose tools are prepared before its read-only
  key mount is attached; the R2 publication step receives no signing secrets.

The repository objects are stored in the private-write
`dotenc-packages` Cloudflare R2 bucket and exposed through the
`packages.dotenc.org` custom domain. Cloudflare is responsible for TLS
termination, WAF enforcement, caching, and managed DDoS mitigation on that
public path. Public `r2.dev` access remains disabled to avoid an origin bypass.
Cloudflare and R2 do not replace package signatures and do not protect against a
compromised signing key or authorized publisher.

Mutable repository objects use a 60-second browser TTL and a 300-second shared
edge TTL. Allowed-path `404` and `410` responses expose
`max-age=0, must-revalidate` to clients, so browsers do not reuse misses;
Cloudflare applies a separate 30-second edge TTL that is not advertised through
`s-maxage`. Origin `5xx` responses are not stored.

APT metadata carries a 14-day `Valid-Until` and is refreshed weekly. RPM and
APK metadata have no client-enforced expiry, so a valid older signed repository
can be replayed to freeze those clients. Weekly freshness monitoring, exact URL
purges, and short mutable-object cache lifetimes detect or reduce accidental
staleness but cannot cryptographically prevent that replay. Rotation also
requires ecosystem-specific handling: RPM 4.x cannot be assumed to learn a new
subkey on an already imported primary certificate, and immutable RPM/APK
packages continue to require the public key that originally signed them. The
canonical package manifest is also pinned to the exact APT primary and signing
fingerprints. The current exact-identity refresh path therefore requires a new
package release when an APT, RPM, or APK signing identity changes. Immutable
OpenPGP certificate object names bind both the primary fingerprint and a digest
of the exact certificate, so a renewed certificate never overwrites an older
object with the same trust root.

Publication remains disabled unless the GitHub repository variable
`LINUX_PACKAGES_ENABLED` is exactly `true`; the signing secrets remain scoped to
the protected `linux-packages` environment. A manual dispatch defaults to a
non-publishing validation mode that may run while the gate is disabled: it
policy-checks the production keys, signs all package variants and repository
roots, verifies them, and installs from clean local repositories, while all
release-asset, artifact-retention, R2, cache-purge, and public-edge steps remain
skipped. Both OpenPGP passphrase secrets are mandatory in this production path.
The gate must stay disabled until that validation, the clean-install matrix,
edge checks, recovery drill, and first signed publication satisfy the launch
runbook.

The operational controls, cache classes, key-custody requirements, publication
order, verification, and recovery procedures are documented in
[Official Linux Package Repositories](docs/LINUX_PACKAGES.md).

## OCI Image Trust Model

The `ghcr.io/dotenc/cli` image packages the compiled standalone CLI for Linux
container environments. Debian/glibc and Alpine/musl variants contain the
`dotenc` binary, `ca-certificates`, and `openssh-client`. The Alpine variant also
contains `libstdc++` and `libgcc`, which its Bun-compiled musl binary requires.
Neither variant includes Node.js, Bun, npm, provider CLIs, application runtimes,
private keys, decrypted `.env` files, or provider tokens.

Security properties:

- **Release-built image** — the image is built from `cli/Dockerfile` by the
  release workflow after CLI version bumps or an authorized image-only manual
  dispatch.
- **Variant separation** — default tags contain the glibc binary; `-alpine`
  tags contain the musl binary. Copy only the variant matching the application
  image's libc.
- **Version pinning** — production CI should pin a specific image tag, and
  higher-assurance deployments should pin the manifest digest, instead of
  relying on the mutable `latest` or `alpine` rolling tags.
- **Release attestations** — published image manifests include BuildKit
  provenance and SBOM attestations as OCI referrers.
- **Non-root default** — the image runs as the unprivileged `dotenc` user by
  default. Use Docker's `--user` option when host-mounted files need the host
  UID/GID.
- **Runner-owned identity** — when `DOTENC_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64`,
  `DOTENC_PRIVATE_KEY`, `DOTENC_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE`, or mounted SSH keys are
  provided to the container, that container is the machine where decryption
  happens. Grant that provider key narrowly.
- **Mount discipline** — mount only the repository paths and optional SSH key
  paths needed for the command. Prefer `DOTENC_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64` with a
  dedicated provider key over mounting a developer's full `~/.ssh` directory in
  automation.

The CLI image is not an application builder image. Commands wrapped by
`dotenc run` execute inside the same container, so they can only use tools
present in that image or mounted into it. For application builds and runtime
decryption, copy `/usr/local/bin/dotenc` from the matching image variant into
the application's existing image and install the documented runtime packages.
Never pass a bootstrap private key through Docker `ARG` or `ENV`; use runtime
environment injection or BuildKit secret mounts.

---

## GitHub Actions Trust Model

The reusable GitHub Actions exposed as `dotenc/*-action@v1` delegate to the
implementation actions in `actions/`, which are thin wrappers around the dotenc
CLI:

- `actions/setup` installs `@dotenc/cli` through npm. Pin the action ref and
  CLI version when workflows need fully reproducible installs.
- `actions/run` writes the requested command to a temporary script and executes
  it through `dotenc run --strict` by default. The CLI still strips
  `DOTENC_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64` and `DOTENC_PRIVATE_KEY` before launching the
  child command, and the action wrappers unset `DOTENC_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64`,
  `DOTENC_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `DOTENC_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE` before running user
  commands.
- `actions/export` decrypts an environment through `dotenc run`, then writes
  only explicitly allowlisted variable names to `$GITHUB_ENV`. Values are
  registered with GitHub log masking before export.
- `actions/write-file` decrypts one named variable and writes it to a file with
  mode `0600` by default. This is intended for file-shaped credentials such as
  service account JSON.

These actions intentionally do not provide a "decrypt everything" mode. Values
exported through `$GITHUB_ENV` remain available to later steps in the same job,
so grant CI keys narrowly and keep allowlists short.

For provider pipelines, the dotenc identity belongs to the runner that actually
needs decrypted values. Use the reusable GitHub Actions only when GitHub
Actions runs the command that needs those values; otherwise, follow the
provider-specific runbook for that provider's own runner.

---

## Known Limitations

- **dotenc does not prompt for passphrases.** To use passphrase-protected SSH keys, provide `DOTENC_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE` in the environment. In interactive key selection flows (`dotenc init`, interactive `dotenc key add`), dotenc can also create an optional passwordless copy (for example `id_ed25519_passwordless`) after explicit user confirmation.
- **No HSM or hardware key support.** Private keys must be accessible as files in
  `~/.ssh/`, via the recommended `DOTENC_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64` environment
  variable, or via the legacy `DOTENC_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable.
  Explicit key selection flags such as `--private-key` and `--from-private-key`
  select from those file-backed keys by name.
- **Revocation is not retroactive.** See [Access Control Model](#access-control-model).
- **No centralized policy engine.** Access control is enforced per-environment and per-repository, not across an organization.
